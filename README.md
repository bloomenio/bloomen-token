# Bloomen wallet
 The prototype consists of four different parts that allow to have a complete and fully operational solution: 

## Bloomen Wallet / [bloomen-wallet-app](bloomen-wallet-app/README.md)
 IOS / Android mobile application that operates directly against the BC and performs the transaction signing tasks. Signature of transactions in device allows us to eliminate middlewares that would put in doubt the security in a decentralized system.

## Bloomen Wallet / [bloomen-wallet-truffle](bloomen-wallet-truffle/README.md)
 The business logic of the application has been developed in SC deployed on Alastria BC. These regulate the flow of cryptocurrencies and prevent the fraudulent use of the services they wish to offer.

## Bloomen Wallet / [bloomen-wallet-cli](bloomen-wallet-cli/README.md)
 Since it is the first iteration of prototype we have chosen to build a command line interface to interact with the SC from the point of view of a service provider.

## Bloomen Wallet / [bloomen-wallet-service-demo](bloomen-wallet-service-demo/README.md)
 In order to have a complete demonstration cycle, a small demonstrator has been developed that allows performing end user actions (purchase and allow).
